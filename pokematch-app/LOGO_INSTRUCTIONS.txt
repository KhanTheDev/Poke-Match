TO ADD YOUR POKÉMATCH LOGO:

1. Save your Pokématch logo image as "pokematch-logo.png"
2. Place it in the same folder as index.html (pokematch-app folder)
3. The app will automatically use your logo image
4. If the image doesn't load, it will fall back to styled text

Your logo should be:
- PNG format (recommended)
- Transparent background
- High quality
- Named exactly "pokematch-logo.png"

The app is already set up to use your logo in:
- Navigation bar (top left)
- Home page title (main heading)

Just drop your logo file in this folder and refresh the browser!
